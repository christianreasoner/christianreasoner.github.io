<p>During the Summers of 2015 and 2016 I volunteered to become a Junior Leader at the Summer Fun program at Kamiloiki elementary school. I initially decided to join this program because many of my friends were thinking about joining and I wanted to be able to have a meaningful and impactful Summer, rather than wasting it at home. Since we were dealing with younger children from grades 1-5, this position required us to set an excellent example in terms of mannerism, attitude, and problem solving. We also had to provide assistance in terms of organizing and making appropriate events and also being responsible for the safety of the children.</p>

<p>At Kamiloiki Summer Fun, most of the Junior Leaders were high school students and we were seen as assistants to the employed Group Leaders. Group Leaders were responsible for around 30 kids per group and us Junior Leaders were evenly divided among all the Group Leaders. Our task was to assist and help control the kids, which could sometimes be extremely chaotic due to the nature of children. Most of our time was spent organizing and monitoring the events that went on during the day. Some of these events were activities such as field games, basketball, and occasional field trips. Our #1 job as a Junior Leader was to insure safety for the children. Especially since there were hundreds of kids enrolled in Summer Fun, itâ€™s extremely easy for the small kids to wander around and get lost. Moreover, kids often fight a lot and may throw tantrums and it was up to us in order to resolve any sort of issue and enforce any necessary actions needed that would help to promote acceptable behavior and responsibility.</p>

<p>While caring for these kids was an enjoyable experience for me, it would sometimes become overwhelming because of how stubborn kids can get. Trying to keep 30+ kids quiet and organized at once is extremely difficult and it would become tedious to deal with. Especially when we would host events such as sports tournaments or dance competitions, we had to teach the kids that these privileges would only be awarded with good behavior. During the course of the Summer we went on a few field trips to places such as Chuck E. Cheese and the water park. These events were extremely fun but us Junior Leaders had to be on high alert because we were responsible for the safety of the children which was especially important when we went to public places.</p>

<p>This experience taught me a lot about patience and how to act appropriately during stressful situations. I had to be able to relate to the kids and be able to understand how they felt in order to efficiently solve whatever issue they had. This included things such as arguments between kids, tantrums, and lots of crying. It reminded me a lot about when I was younger and it gave me a good sense of how setting a good example for these kids can go a long way. Being respectful is one of the most important attributes to develop during your youth and it was very enjoyable to be able to help these children grow and develop acceptable behavior and attitude.</p>
