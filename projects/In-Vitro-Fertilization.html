<p>In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is a common assisted reproductive method that follows a complex series of procedures in order to help with fertility, help to prevent genetic problems, and help to conceive a child. As a quick overview, IVF involves collecting eggs from a mothers ovaries and fertilizing them by sperm within a lab. The embryos are then transferred back to the mothers uterus and undergo careful observation until a child is developed. IVF is a very tedious and delicate process that can take around a month for one cycle. Moreover, this procedure is extremely expensive at around $15,000 and organizations around the world are trying to find ways to make IVF more accessible to mothers.</p>

<p>During Fall 2021 I partook in a project course and joined the <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/uh-vip/project/micro-vip/">Micro VIP</a> team at UH Manoa. Under Dr. Thomas Huang and Dr. Aaron Ohta, our team worked on an application (developed with TKinter) that utilized a neural network to calculate the size of an embryo based on video segmentations. The goal of this project was to assist in accurately measuring the growth rate of an embryo which is extremely important during the IVF procedure as it can determine which embryos are healthy or not. Choosing healthy embryos can vastly improve the time it takes for the IVF procedure which can also lead to lower costs as well.</p>

<p>I joined the ‘Application’ sub team which consisted of two other members. We were tasked with collaborating with the ‘Neural Network’ sub team to implement an ‘initial embryo area’ feature and an ‘initial percent threshold’ feature in order to provide more useful and precise information for the embryologists at Dr. Huang’s lab. Both of these features allowed for user input in order to manipulate either the embryo’s initial area measurement or the percent threshold at which to start graphing the growth rate. My contributions to this project mainly dealt with the GUI side of the application. I was tasked with using TKinter in order to design a way to efficiently gather user input and use that data to manipulate the data obtained from the embryos.</p>

<p>Teamwork was a huge cornerstone of this project, especially with how small our team was. We had to meet strict deadlines that consisted of project reports, weekly meetings, and a poster session that explained our entire application both frontend and backend. This project course gave me my first taste of what it’s like to be a Software Engineer and work under a team. The biggest takeaway from this project course is that communication is extremely important and you must be able to meet your deadlines, especially if you are working with a team. Coding style and organized documentation was also a key takeaway as it allows others to understand your programming logic, especially when trying to present it during team meetings.</p>
