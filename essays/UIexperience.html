  <p>Through my first week of learning Bootstrap I was able to understand the efficiency that UI frameworks provide. Building web pages is an extremely frustrating task as you have to not only worry about the functionality of the web page, but you also need to incorporate a user-friendly design that is pleasing to the eye. Html/css are the standard languages for creating web pages and from personal experience they’re extremely difficult to use. UI frameworks are a great way to speed up the development process as it enables developers to create beautiful UI’s without having to fully understand the technical requirements behind the language.</p>

<p>Learning Bootstrap has been a slow process for me. However, I fully understand how beneficial it can be and how it greatly speeds up the frontend development process. The issues that I faced the most with Bootstrap is learning all the different element/class names. I found myself frequently looking at past WOD’s or documentation in order to create a webpage. This learning curve is somewhat similar to learning a new programming language as it requires constant practice in order to understand/memorize the different components. Another challenge with UI design I faced was being creative and picking good colors for the web page. Many people often overlook this aspect as it is relatively simple. Picking a color is extremely easy to do but picking a good combination of colors that captivates the user is extremely difficult. Moreover, this is one of the most important aspects of a good UI as colors play a huge psychological role in humans.</p>

<p>Having some experience with UI design has given me insight to how complex it can really be. Being creative is probably the most important trait to have if you want to be a good UI designer. Being a good UI designer isn’t really based on how good you are with the programming languages involved but rather creating an efficient web page that displays the content in an efficient manner. Color blocked homepages is an example of a commonly used design pattern. This pattern incorporates various colors in order to separate sections of a web page and is popular due to the simplicity of it and how it is perceived by users. UI frameworks are what allow developers to quickly design patterns such as the color blocked homepage. Moreover, many issues arrive when switching between display sizes, devices, and resizing. UI frameworks provide many functionalities that are tailored to this issue and in particular, Bootstrap is considered mobile-first which basically means that its styles are built to be responsive. This is extremely important because not every user is going to be on a laptop or a 15in. screen and it’s important to have a nice UI for each scenario.</p>

<p>Example of a color blocked homepage style UI using Bootstrap:</p>
