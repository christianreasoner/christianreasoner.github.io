ICS 314 has taught me a lot about application frameworks and how there is much more to learn than just the various languages. This course was fast paced and went over new topics each week. I believe the overall goal of this was to give the students a quick introduction to the different aspects that go into software development and building applications and web interfaces. What stuck with me the most out of this class was the importance of coding standards and project management as they revolve around working with a team and keeping your work organized and readable.

Project management is an essential skill to learn because most of the time software engineers will be working with a team and programming can become extremely confusing, especially when multiple people are working on the same code. GitHub is an extremely popular service that aids in the organization of software development. Some things that I noticed that were extremely helpful were the ability to create branches within software projects, being able to create issues which are problems/bugs that need to be fixed, and also the ability to merge/pull code. Professor Moore also gave a good tip on the use of the ‘issues’ functionality which is to always have only one issue ‘in progress’ and to make sure that you have created a good amount of issues in the ‘to do’ state. This allows your other team members to know what you’re working on and can save complications.

Coding standards are something that I never knew about until this course. This concept mainly deals with the format of your code and how it is organized and the syntax used. This can often be overlooked because it doesn’t necessarily affect the functionality of the code because it is purely for organization and readability. However, these things are extremely important when working in teams and open source projects. We all know that everyone codes in their own unique style and when multiple people have to read/write code on the same software, it may be hard for everyone to understand what others are trying to accomplish. Coding standards will assist in cleaning up code and making sure everyone follows a strict standard. This allows for easier readability which leads to greater efficiency when programming.

These concepts revolve around teamwork and creating a work environment that’s organized and easier to understand. I feel that this is the most important aspect when it comes to software engineering because the faster you understand something, the faster you can work on it. Having to look at unorganized work or not having a project management plan can be extremely detrimental and can cause workflow to slow down which can cost companies lots of money when it comes to software projects.
