<p>Using ESLint has been surprisingly useful and has given me more assurance rather than headaches. Originally, I thought ESLint would be another annoying rule checker that would constantly give me a handful of errors and would be more of a nuisance than something beneficial. However, ESLint seamlessly integrated its way into the IntelliJ IDE and has taught me a lot about proper coding standards. Moreover, I learned that these coding standards don’t just make your code neater, they actually helped me to learn a lot about JavaScript and how to become a more efficient programmer.</p>

<p>Before ESLint, I never really understood coding standards and how many different variations and types there are. I was able to learn that these standards are constantly used within the software engineering community, especially in large companies. Coding standards require programmers to follow a set of ‘rules’ that affect things such as formatting styles, naming conventions, and variable declarations. While some people may think that this is pointless because it is just for “looks”, it actually benefits programming efficiency by a large margin. This is especially true within open source software because every individual has their own style of programming and it can sometimes be hard to understand what some person is trying to accomplish and that roadblock can often lead to hours of just trying to understand someone else’s code before trying to expand on it. This is crucial because it wastes time which can cost a fortune, especially with large projects.</p>

<p>Getting green checkmarks with ESLint gives me extra assurance that my code is following standards. Not only does it give you that satisfaction but when errors do arise that revolve around the coding standards they are often really easy to fix with just a few buttons. You will often be given the recommended “fix” to the problem in which you can press a combination of buttons that will automatically fix the issue. This just adds another l	layer of efficiency and is extremely helpful, especially for students that are just starting to learn about new programming languages such as JavaScript. So far I’ve thoroughly enjoyed ESLint and am glad I was able to learn about coding standards in general because most large-scale companies will incorporate some sort of standard and it’s beneficial to know why and how they are helpful with programming efficiency.</p>
